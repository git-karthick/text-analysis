Field Name Updates
	•	Given the IDDA AOQ Contacts tab is accessed
	•	When field name updates are implemented
	•	Then update these fields exactly:
	•	“EZREC Exception” → “DDA Reconciler Exception”
	•	“EZREC Reconciler Name” → “DDA Reconciler Name”
	•	“EZREC Approver Name” → “DDA Approver Name”
System Requirements
	•	Given the changes are deployed
	•	When users access the system
	•	Then:
	•	All existing functionality remains intact
	•	All existing data is preserved
	•	Only new field names are visible
	•	No broken references or errors occur
Validation
	•	Given implementation is complete
	•	When testing is performed
	•	Then:
	•	Field labels display correct new names
	•	Input, validation, and saving work as expected
	•	Changes reflect consistently across all related screens
