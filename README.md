Hi Atiya,
The problems we talked about are still there, and now I’m seeing more issues since last Friday (August 1). The intents, cost center, and configs we created recently are missing in SIT. Even the data you set up for us last Thursday (July 31) is not there anymore.
Can you check what’s going on? Let me know if you need more details or logs from my side.
