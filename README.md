Subject: Functional Testing Improvement Plan for TrBIS

Hi Team,

Currently, app lacks documented functional test cases. To improve this, here’s a high-level plan:

1. Identify all key scenarios (6 major ones) and map existing functionalities.  
2. Create detailed test cases for each scenario, covering positive, negative, and edge cases.  
3. Classify test cases by business severity and priority to focus on critical flows.  
4. Identify and build a core regression suite for frequent and high-risk scenarios.  
5. Automate critical and stable GUI workflows using the Playwright framework for efficiency.

This phased approach will help establish thorough test coverage, reduce defects, and enable smoother releases. More details can follow once we finalize the scenarios.

Thanks,  
[Your Name]
