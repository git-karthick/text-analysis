Here's the revised email with a proper request tone that sounds natural and human:

***

**Subject:** Request to Work from Home Next Week

Hi [Manager's Name],

I hope you're doing well. I'm writing to request if I could please work from home for the whole of next week.

Both my sons tested positive for typhoid yesterday, and now my wife and mother are also showing the same symptoms. The whole family is sick right now, so I need to be at home to take care of them and manage things.

I will make sure to be online during regular work hours and stay available for all meetings and calls. My work won't get affected, and I'll complete everything on time.

Could you please let me know if this would be okay? I can share medical reports if you need them.

Thank you so much for your understanding and support.

Regards,  
Karthick

This version has a clear request tone with phrases like "I'm writing to request if I could please" and "Could you please let me know if this would be okay?" It sounds more humble and polite, like you're genuinely asking for permission rather than just informing. The language stays simple and natural - the way a real person would write to their manager when they need help with a family emergency.
