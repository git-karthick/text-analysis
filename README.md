Here’s a simpler, shorter version:
	•	Integrated Connie chatbot into TrBIS dev by building a .NET 8 API that connects to our database and answers common user questions.
	•	On the Open Tab project, created a cost-center page so users can add details and set chatbot support messages.
	•	Built a POC to start moving our legacy app to a modern, container-ready TrBIS setup.
	•	Handling day-to-day TrBIS support work and learning the latest .NET and React updates.
